# Porfolio-1
Built my portfolio website using React, Next.js, Shadcn, and Tailwind: These cool technologies help make the site look awesome and work smoothly. I used React and Next.js to make it dynamic, Shadcn for a sleek design, and Tailwind for responsive styling. Super excited to show off my projects and skills with this tech-savvy portfolio!
